anger," I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? "
anger, You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
anger," Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . "

anger," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
neutral, do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? 
happiness," Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . "
neutral," I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . "
neutral, It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
neutral,Hurry up . Time is running out . 
happiness," Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this "

neutral, What's the color of her eyes ? 
happiness," Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . "
neutral," Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . "
neutral, No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way .

happiness," There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . "
neutral, Are you there yet ? 
neutral, It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .

neutral, Ok . Goodbye .

People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted .

Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . "

sadness, I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . 
sadness, Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . 
neutral,I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? 
happiness,"How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? "
anger, Just what I thought ! 
anxiety,"Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! "
anxiety," I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! "

neutral, Why do you like it best ? 
neutral, I would like to check out these books . 
anger, I am very grateful for your advice . 
anger, It's my pleasure to talk with you . 
neutral," Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . "
neutral," No problem , come on . "
happiness," I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan . "
happiness, I'm doing really well .

anger, I'm glad . 
happiness," Yes , of course , please follow me . "
happiness," Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? "
happiness,"Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . "

anger," Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? "
anger, Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
anger, Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
anger, It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
neutral,Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days .

anger, That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 
neutral, Don't be such a chicken ! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie . 
sadness, It sounds too bad . What will you do ? 
neutral, You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
happiness,I like your new skirt . 
neutral,"David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? "
sadness, I ’ m not in the mood .

Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures .

sadness, I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
sadness," I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . "

sadness," Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake . "
sadness, I really wish I hadn ’ t done it .

sadness," Yes , I have . But I have to wait . "
neutral, which one has the most interesting course ? 
happiness, Yes.That would be good . 
sadness, I sure did . 
neutral, It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
happiness, there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
happiness, Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy .

anger, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
anger," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . "

neutral, Can you speak any other languages ? 
neutral,"Mary , do you remember when we met ? "

neutral, That's right . 
anger,It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
anger, What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
anger," Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . "
anger, Fine ! I want a divorce !

happiness," Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . "
sadness,"I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . "
sadness, I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . 
sadness, I already had that idea . 
sadness, I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . 
neutral, How long do you usually stay at university ? 
neutral, Three or four years . 
happiness," Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . "
neutral," oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . "
anger, Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . 
anger," Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . "
happiness,I think it's going to be a nice day . 
neutral," Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . "
happiness, Sure . 
neutral, What kind of dancing do you like ?

sadness,I feel pity for the old man . 
sadness, I feel the same way .

happiness, It can't be true . 
neutral,"All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . "
neutral, Yes . She lives on the next block . 
neutral," Be quick , please . Our teacher and classmates will come soon . "
happiness, He's diving for the gold .

happiness, he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
happiness," Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it . "
happiness, The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . 
neutral," That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . "
happiness, You ’ re welcome . 
happiness," We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . "

neutral," I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . "
anger,Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
anger, But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
anger, You know you didn't . 
anger," Yes , but you might have told me before . "
anger, You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
anger," Oh , you men ! You're all the same . "
neutral," Oh , does she ? That's convenient . "
happiness," Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? "

happiness, That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? 
happiness," No , I'm not hungry . "
anger, Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . 
neutral," Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . "
neutral,Do you know that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
happiness, This dish is really delicious . 
happiness," Sure , we call it doubt . "
neutral," Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . "

happiness," Me too . So , do you like the course ? "

sadness," it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . "
sadness," I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . "
happiness,"Ashley , what a great dinner party ! "
happiness," Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . "

anger,"I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . "
anger, You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . 
neutral, Maybe that's why he's so nice !

anger," How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . "
sadness," You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go . "
anger, It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility .

anger, I just don't trust you any more .

happiness, Thank you for making a reservation with us . We look forward to seeing you in April ! 
happiness," Well , that was fun . Let's do it again soon . "
neutral," First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . "
happiness, Perfect ! I like this one . 
happiness, That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 
neutral," One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? "
neutral," I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you . "

Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ... "
sadness," Sorry , sir . We have only tables in the main dinning room left . "
happiness, Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . 
happiness, You are welcome . 
neutral, Will this table be all right ? 
happiness, Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . 
happiness," No problem , Miss . "
neutral, I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four .

neutral, OK . I'll try on a medium size . 
sadness," I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . "
anger, But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
sadness, Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . 
sadness," Oh , my computer crashed again ! "
anxiety, It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
anxiety, I'm bleeding too much . 
anxiety," Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! "
neutral," Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . "
anxiety," No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . "
anger, Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
anger, How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?

sadness, They said that they did . I've been so busy ... 
anger, And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 
anger, It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets !

neutral," Yeah , I got home around two . "
neutral, Maybe you should . 
neutral, I took Accounting as my major . 
happiness, Thank you . I'll bring your order right away . 
neutral," I am sorry you don't like it , sir . But that's just the special point of the dish . "
neutral, Is it ? 
happiness, Thanks . 
happiness, Thank you . 
anger, I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! 
anger," Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! "
neutral, Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ? 
neutral, Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ? 
sadness, My mother just passed away last Tuesday . 
happiness, That was easy !

anger, But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! 
sadness," I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . "
neutral," Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . "
neutral,"Excuse me , I'm looking for your 3 - liter Pepsis , the ones that are on sale this week . There don't seem to be any in the soft drink section . "
neutral," We may be sold out of them . Let me check the back . ( The clerk goes to the storeroom , returning a few minutes later . ) I'm afraid we're out of stock . Would you like a rain check ? "

anger,I'm going crazy . 
neutral, You can find an airsick bag in the seat pocket in front of you . 
neutral,Could I be of any help to you ? 
neutral," yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . "
happiness,Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ... 
happiness," Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan ! "
happiness, Good . 
happiness, Splendid .

sadness, I can ’ t believe it ! I guess I ’ ll be here until ten again tonight ! 
neutral,What is the most enjoyable part about your job ? 
sadness," I want to go fishing today , but I have left my rod and fishing line at home . "
neutral, Is the seed edible ? 
neutral, These are from Mexico . 
neutral, What seems to be the problem ? 
neutral, That'll be no problem . 
anger," Whatever . Just turn right here . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . let ’ s take a side street . Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! "
anger, What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
neutral," Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . "
sadness," Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . "
sadness," No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . "
neutral," Yeah , sorry . "
neutral, I am too introverted to let others become my friends . 
neutral, $ 59.95 . 
neutral," Sorry , sir . "
neutral,"Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? "
neutral," I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? "
neutral, I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
neutral," I see . One ticket to London , please . "
neutral," It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . "

anger, I wasn't done talking to you . 
anger," I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . "
anger, I really don't think it's any of your business . 
anger, That's not nice . 
sadness," I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . "
happiness, Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . 
neutral, At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays . 
anger, You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! 
anger, Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! 
happiness, I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? 
sadness, I'm afraid that's the best we can do .

anger," Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . "
neutral, Have you received any honorable title personally ? 
happiness," Nothing else , thank you . "
neutral," It's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . Here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . The cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a main street . "
happiness, Thank you . That would be great . 
neutral, Are your prices negotiable ? 
neutral," Your satisfaction is guaranteed , or we refund your money . "
neutral, I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys 
happiness, I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
happiness, Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . 
happiness," That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . "
neutral, Here is my card . Can I have them delivered to this address ? 
neutral," I'd like to order a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . "
happiness, I need it . Thank you .

neutral, How much are they ? 
neutral, Your reservation is right . Please get a ticket booking form from there and fill it . 
happiness, I'm only too happy to help . 
neutral, You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . 
happiness, I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you . 
happiness," Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio "
neutral," It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again . "
anger, Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . 
happiness,It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! 
happiness, Good idea . 
neutral," I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . "
neutral," When I have time , I sometimes draw and paint . "
happiness, I appreciate that . 
happiness, The chicken is out of this world ! 
anxiety, I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . 
neutral," I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . "
neutral, There's no particular place that you want to look at ? 
neutral," It will take about 20 minutes , sir . Is that all right ? "
neutral," Yes , it is . Oh , by the way , could you also bring me today's paper ? "
sadness,"It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you've had to wait . "

anger, It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
neutral,How do we do timesheets here ?

happiness, Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work . 
neutral, What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
anger," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! "
anger," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . "
anger," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
neutral, Of course . 
happiness, That sounds all right to us . 
neutral,"Excuse me , how many sightseeing spots are there in the park ? "
neutral," Yes , some of the spots charges separately . "
neutral," OK , you mean the vacant one on the left ? "
neutral,"Good evening , madam . May I help you ? "
happiness, By all means . 
happiness, You're welcome . 
neutral," If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk . "
neutral," Yes , that's very important . "

happiness, Thank youse much for all your help . 
sadness," Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . "
sadness,I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
sadness," Yes , I can't sleep well every night . "
sadness, I drink a lot of wine . 
sadness, I often feel so tired . 
anxiety, I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
neutral, When does it arrive ? 
sadness, That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . 
sadness, Sorry . The road is too crowded . 
sadness, Sorry . We mustn't stop here . 
happiness, I hope that we can continue our cooperation . 
neutral," So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . "
anger," Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . "
neutral, Really . 
neutral, And not expensive either . 
happiness, But thank you very much all the same . 
sadness," Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . "
neutral, How about this afternoon ? 
happiness, Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . 
neutral," Yes , the wine list is at the end of the menu . "
sadness, It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . 
neutral," Yes , we have a reservation for three nights.Mona White . I called last week . "
neutral, We'd like quiet rooms thanks . 
neutral,You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after 
sadness,I am sorry to say this but I seem to have lost the key to the safe . 
happiness, It ’ s a good thing that you read that ad today . 
sadness, Yes . I have my wallet stolen . 
neutral," Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? "
neutral," If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . "
neutral, I took this course last semester too . Now I am taking it again ! 
neutral," Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? "
neutral, I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . 
anger,I have to talk to you ! 
anger," I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . "
neutral, Less than one hour . 
neutral," Oh , yes . It's on Wednesday morning . Sorry about that . "
sadness, I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . 
neutral, Do you mind if I go with you ? 
happiness, It's a perfect fit . 
neutral, Let me know if you do need anything . 
anger,Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 
anger," Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . "
anger," Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . "
happiness, I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? 
happiness," that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . "
neutral, I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing . 
neutral," That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? "
neutral, She already bought that evening gown .

sadness," No , I am single . "

anger, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
anger, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
happiness," Thank you , sir . Could you sign the voucher here , please ? "
sadness,"Sorry , I'm late . "
anger, What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
anger, I didn't do anything .

anger," I don't need your help , jerk . "
neutral, Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . 
anxiety," He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! "
neutral, I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! 
anger, His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! 
neutral," He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . "
anxiety," Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . "

anger, You ’ re a liar ! 
sadness, That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . 
sadness," Hmm , that is bad . "
neutral," Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? "
neutral," Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . "
happiness, All right . Thank you very much . 
happiness," OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes . "
neutral, Could you tell me more about it ?

neutral," Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . "

If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . "

neutral, Yes . I ’ Ve get a small room . 
neutral," You've got it , sir . "
neutral, Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? 
happiness, I ’ m going to be fine . 
neutral," Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . "
happiness, Thanks . 
neutral,This is the rush hour . 
neutral," Good morning , I'd like a haircut . "
neutral," It ’ s very nice meeting you , too . "
neutral, I feel that people can love who they want .

neutral," Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ’ s a 30 - day notice to vacate . "
neutral, You can ’ t make me move just for being late with my rent . 
anger," Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! "
anger," Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . "

happiness, Ok . Thank you very much . 
sadness,I can't get into my room . I mean I left my room key inside . 
anger," Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . "
neutral, It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . 
sadness, Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . 
sadness," Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . "
anger," Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . "
anger," Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . "
neutral, Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
neutral," Oh , we've got plenty of time . "
neutral, Just go through the No . 8 ticket-barrier over there . A train will be in directly .

happiness, Sure . What time would you like to come ? 
happiness," Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow . "
anger,I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
sadness, I ’ m afraid not . I apologize . 
anger, I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . 
sadness, I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? 
anger," Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! "
neutral, I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . 
happiness," Then I will send it by air , thank you . "
anger, That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
anger, Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
anger, I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
happiness, They have the freshest foods there . 
neutral, They don't have a lot of organic foods there . 
happiness," Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me . "
neutral, How about drink ? 
neutral," Sir , are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times ? "

neutral," I apologize . One moment , please , while I transfer you to my supervisor . "
neutral, Did you eat something strange ? 
neutral, Yes.There are the Huangshan Hotel and Anshan Hotel nearby.And you can take a taxi to go there . 
sadness, I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
anger, I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 
anger," This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! "
neutral, What's wrong with Sons ? 
neutral," Well , it's about 65 cm at the moment . Could we increase it by about a third ? "
neutral,"so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? "
neutral, That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
neutral," yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . "

happiness, thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste .

neutral,"Excuse me , may I help you ? "
neutral, How fresh is that apple pie over there ? 
neutral," That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? "
neutral, Could you tell me shall I take the express or local train ? 
neutral, It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside . 
sadness,"Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . "
sadness," Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . "
anger," Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! "
anger," It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . "
anger," That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! "
happiness, Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 
anxiety," What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! "
anxiety, I can smell smoke ! 
anxiety, Gosh ! I can see the flames ! 
happiness," Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? "
neutral,How much are these in all ? 
sadness, My fish is pretty dry too . 
sadness, It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . 
sadness, Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . 
happiness, Thanks for your help . 
neutral," I'll pick a shampoo that's just right for your hair type . Sit right here , and rest your neck on the side of the sink . Is the water too hot ? "
happiness," OK ! You're all set ! Come back with me to your seat , and Eva will be right with you . "
happiness, All right . Thanks a lot . 
neutral, It is really like a labyrinth . 
sadness, I am sorry . That table has been booked . 
neutral, It doesn't matter . This one is fine . 
happiness, I really appreciate all your help .

happiness," Of course . I made apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . "
happiness," Yes , certainly.Would you wait for a few minutes ? "
happiness, Sure . I'll be back in a minute . 
neutral, Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by . 
neutral," No , not that one . The big one . "
sadness,"It's your turn , sir.Sorry to keep you waiting . "
neutral,How can I help you ? 
neutral, Your parallel parking isn't all that great . 
neutral, I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . 
neutral,What kind of strong suit do you get ? 
happiness,"Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . ' "

neutral, Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . 
neutral, What do you think will happen ? 
anger, That's sheer robbery ! 
sadness, No . That price would hardly cover the cost . 
neutral, What are you going to do to it ? 
neutral,"Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? "
happiness, Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? 
anger, Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
happiness," That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? "
neutral, Right . 
sadness, What a pity ! I should have come earlier . 
happiness, Thanks a lot . 
happiness," Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute.Here you are . "
anger,"This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . "

neutral, Maybe I want an apple pie .

neutral, I just like jogging . 
happiness, Very comfortable . I'll take them . 
neutral," Well , what kind of books does she like ? "

neutral, Will that be it ? 
happiness," Yeah , I love red apples . "
happiness, Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
neutral," But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . "
sadness," Sorry , madam . I afraid you have a wrong number.we don't have Mr Over here . "
neutral," No , you give a wrong number . "
sadness," oh , I'm sorry to bother you . "

anger, I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . 
happiness," Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool . "
happiness, That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 
neutral," Yes , this is the Resume Writing Workshop . Welcome ! "
neutral," The blood test is for cholesterol , white blood cell count , and blood sugar . "

anger, I really do hate public transportation . 
anger," I agree , it's just never on time . "
anger, I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather .

anger," Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . "
anger," I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines .

anxiety, Too bad . I really like it . 
neutral, Where is the fitting room ? 
neutral, What is your weakness ?

anger,We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them and then left.
sadness,A friend told me that he had suffered in love and in academics.  I shared his sadness.
anxiety,"When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very frightened."
anger,Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence because of traditional moral values.  
sadness,My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not expect too much from going to the university.
anxiety,After listening to ghost stories with my classmates I had to back alone to the hostel at night.  I had to walk through a long and quiet road and I was scared of meeting a ghost.
anger,"I came across a girl at the school bus-stop, I had seen her several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."
sadness,My examination results were not satisfactory even though I had tried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major subject if I were to change it.
anxiety,"I did not do well in one of the subjects last term.   I was afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D, though it was not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
anger,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not say anything but just watched me leave."
sadness,Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all      good I felt a little sad.
anxiety,At primary school the teacher caught me cheating during a dictation.
anger,Someone spread rumours about me.
sadness,One night my father suddenly suffered from a heart attack which lead to breathing difficulties.
anxiety,At night when I was alone at home (all the family members usually get together at that time) someone knocked vigorously on the door.
anger,When I saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess I guessed that someone else had used my daily necessities.  I felt that my  personal sanity had been affected.
sadness,During the Physics experiment session I did not understand the content of the experiment and did not know how to do it.
anxiety,"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
anger,The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This made me angry.
sadness,"When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives and my tears made me sad."
happiness,"In August,1983, the long awaited \big envelope\"" (a document for C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag, knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe.  It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."""
anxiety,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me \ A failure, You lost 5 marks.\""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."""
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
anxiety,My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.
anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another child to teach.
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others would think that I had not prepared for it.
